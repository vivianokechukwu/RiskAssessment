<h1>Data Breach Risk Assessment for a Retail Company & Regulatory Change Risk Assessment for a Financial Firm </h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

I conducted two high-impact risk assessments: a data breach in a multinational retailer where a phishing attack exposed customer PII and payment data, and a regulatory change in a financial services firm adapting to stricter data protection mandates. In both cases, I identified critical assets, threats, and vulnerabilities, rated risks as High, and developed mitigation strategies covering technical controls (MFA, encryption, SIEM), governance (DPO, compliance task force), and staff training.

<h2> Data Breach – Multinational Retailer</h2>

A phishing attack compromised employee credentials, leading to unauthorized access to a customer database containing PII and payment data.

- Risk Level: High (Very Likely, Critical Impact)

- Key Mitigations: Enforced MFA, deployed SIEM, introduced phishing awareness training, and applied network segmentation.

- Deliverable: Cybersecurity Risk Register & Treatment Plan (aligned with GDPR, PCI DSS, CCPA).

<br />

<h2> Regulatory Change – Financial Services Firm</h2>

New government regulations introduced stricter requirements for data protection, encryption, and accountability in handling customer information.

- Risk Level: High (Likely, High Impact)

- Key Mitigations: Established compliance task force with a DPO, updated policies, conducted PIAs, implemented encryption/DLP, and scheduled compliance audits.

- Deliverable: Compliance Risk Register & Governance Roadmap (aligned with GDPR, HIPAA, financial regulations).

<h2>Outcomes </h2>

- Strengthened defenses against phishing and insider threats<br>
- Improved compliance posture and regulatory readiness<br>
- Reduced exposure to financial penalties and reputational harm<br>
- Promoted a security-aware and compliance-driven culture across both organizations<br>
