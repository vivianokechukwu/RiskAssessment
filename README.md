<h1>Data Breach Risk Assessment & Regulatory Compliance</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
I Conducted two high-impact risk assessments: a data breach scenario where a phishing attack exposed customer PII and payment data in a multinational retail corporation, and a regulatory change scenario for a financial services firm adapting to new data protection mandates. For both, I identified assets, threats, and vulnerabilities, rated risks as High, and developed mitigation strategies covering technical controls (MFA, encryption, SIEM), governance (DPO, compliance task force), and awareness training. Outcomes included stronger data protection, regulatory alignment, and improved resilience against cyber and compliance risks.

<h2> Data Breach Risk Assessment – Multinational Retailer</h2>

A phishing attack compromised employee credentials, leading to unauthorized access to a customer database containing PII and payment data.

### Assessment:<br>
**Likelihood:** Very Likely<br>
**Impact:** Critical<br>
**Risk Level:** High

### Key Mitigations:<br>
- Enforced MFA across internal systems<br>
- Deployed SIEM for real-time phishing detection and monitoring<br>
- Introduced phishing awareness training for staff<br>
- Applied network segmentation to restrict access to sensitive databases.

**Deliverable:** Cybersecurity Risk Register and Treatment Plan (aligned with GDPR, PCI DSS, CCPA).  

<br />

<h2> Regulatory Changes Risk Assessment – Financial Services Firm</h2>

New government regulations introduced stricter requirements for data protection, encryption, and accountability in handling customer information.

### Assessment:
**Likelihood:** Likely<br>
**Impact:** High<br>
**Risk Level:** High<br>

### Key Mitigations:
- Established a Regulatory Compliance Task Force and appointed a DPO<br>
- Updated data protection and retention policies<br>
- Conducted Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) across business processes<br>
- Implemented encryption, DLP tools, and data classification frameworks<br>
- Scheduled regular compliance audits and reporting processes

**Deliverable:** Compliance Risk Register and Governance Roadmap (aligned with GDPR, HIPAA, and financial regulatory standards).

<h2>Outcomes </h2>

- Strengthened defenses against phishing and insider threats<br>
- Improved compliance posture and regulatory readiness<br>
- Reduced exposure to financial penalties and reputational harm<br>
- Promoted a security-aware and compliance-driven culture across both organizations<br>
